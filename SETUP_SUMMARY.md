## Next Steps

### 1. Set Up Supabase

Create a [Supabase](https://supabase.com) account and:

1. **Create a new project**

2. **Copy your project credentials** to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Then add your Supabase URL and anon key.

3. **Create database tables** using the SQL provided in PROJECT_README.md

4. **Enable authentication** in Supabase settings

### 2. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### 3. Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The production build will be in the `dist/` directory.

### 4. Additional Features to Implement

The following pages/features are referenced in routing but need to be created:

- [ ] `/exercises/new` - Add new exercise form
- [ ] `/exercises/edit/:id` - Edit exercise form
- [ ] `/groups/new` - Create new group form
- [ ] `/groups/:id` - Individual group page
- [ ] `/groups/:id/statistics` - Group statistics page
- [ ] Password reset functionality
- [ ] Email verification handling
- [ ] File upload for profile pictures
- [ ] Exercise form with auto-save
- [ ] Group statistics and leaderboards
- [ ] Real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions

### 5. Testing

Consider adding:
- Jest for unit testing
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Cypress for end-to-end testing

### 6. Additional Dependencies to Consider

```bash
# Form handling
npm install react-hook-form zod @hookform/resolvers

# Icons
npm install lucide-react

# Toast notifications
npm install react-hot-toast

# Date picker
npm install react-datepicker
```

## Project Status

âœ… **READY FOR DEVELOPMENT**

The project structure is complete and the build is successful. You can now:
1. Set up your Supabase backend
2. Start the development server
3. Begin implementing the remaining features

## Build Status

- TypeScript compilation: âœ… PASSING
- Production build: âœ… SUCCESSFUL
- Bundle size: ~442 KB (gzipped: ~131 KB)

## Important Notes

- The project uses Tailwind CSS v4 which has a different API than v3
- Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+ is recommended (currently using 20.5.1)
- All type imports use `type` keyword for verbatim module syntax
- Protected routes redirect unauthenticated users to login
- Public routes redirect authenticated users to dashboard
